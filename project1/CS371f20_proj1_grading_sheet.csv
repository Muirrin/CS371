"For Q&A tasks, fill your answers in the cell, or at least fill “A”, “P” or “N” in all the ”Your self-evaluation” cells. 
A-all finished   P-Partially finished  N-None finished
If you mark the task “N”, it receives 25% of max possible points for the task (It does not apply to extra-point tasks).
If you leave it blank, it receives 0 points. 
If your mark the task ""A"" or ""P"" but zero work is done for the task, then it receives 0 points.
Please leave ""score"" cells blank for course staff
If your code does not build,  your code will not receive more than 50% of max possible points",,,,,

"Based on your intuition, on reading man pages, and on the information in the trace files, pick three system calls placed by the Java HelloWorld program and say what you think they do (hint: use man). ",4,"Open_at: opens or creates a file matching the path name passed to it. Returns a fd and the reference number future system calls use to reference the file.
Mprotect: protects a region of memory. Offer different levels of protection, including no access, read only, write only, and more. Changes the access protections for memory pages within the address range passed to it.
Futex: works as a wait operation with fast user locking. Process waits until a condition becomes true and works mostly when doing shared memory synchronization. This call is used after mmap(), which creates a place for the futex in the memory.

"In lecture, we discussed how C library translates a C lib function such as open to sys_open. It is easy to understand how this works for a C program. However, does this still apply to Java programs? State your reasoning with evidence.",4,"No, this translation is not applied to Java programs which we can see by how many openat() calls are made for library functions. This is also one of the reasons for the vast difference between the different languages' amount of system calls.",0,,0
