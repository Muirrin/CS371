"For Q&A tasks, fill your answers in the cell, or at least fill “A”, “P” or “N” in all the ”Your self-evaluation” cells. 
A-all finished   P-Partially finished  N-None finished
If you mark the task “N”, it receives 25% of max possible points for the task (It does not apply to extra-point tasks).
If you leave it blank, it receives 0 points. 
If your mark the task ""A"" or ""P"" but zero work is done for the task, then it receives 0 points.
Please leave ""score"" cells blank for course staff
If your code does not build,  your code will not receive more than 50% of max possible points",,,,,
